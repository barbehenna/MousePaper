# MousePaper

The goal of this project is to better understand one method of estimating population statistics of a group via catch-and-release. We do this by simulation. We have a simulation written in C++ to generate many random studies. Each of these studies are then aggregated and analyzed with an R script. There is also a Shiny app that can be updated to show what the raw trap  data looks like (on the indiviual and pooled scales).(To use the app you may need to roll back the SimulationBackend.R a few commits, before it was moved to  8 squares.)
